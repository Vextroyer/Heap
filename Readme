On this repo there are implementations on several languages
of the heap data structure.

Maybe some algorithms using this structure will also e implemented on
the future, such as heapsort, and other structures such as the priority
queue.

A heap is a binary tree who mantains several invariants:
1- All the levels of the tree are complete except, perhaps, the last one.
2- Insertions are done from left to right on the last uncomplete level, or in
a new level if all the previous levels are complete.
Deletions works the same but from right to left.
3- For all child nodes y from node x holds that x R y where R is an order relation.
For example x <= y  (or x >= y)
