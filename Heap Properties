Here are listed several heap properties:

The minimum number of elements in a heap of height h
is 2^h, and the maximum number of elements is 2^h(+1) - 1.


The height of a heap of n-elements is at most log n.


On any subtree of a max-heap(min-heap) the root of the subtree
is the maximum(minimum) element.


The kth largest element of a heap appears on level at most k assuming
all elements to be different.


A increasingly-sorted array is a min-heap.
A decreasingly-sorted array is a max-heap.
